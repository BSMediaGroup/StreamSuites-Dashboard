# Runtime Compatibility Notes

## Rumble Runtime Status

- **Current state:** Paused due to an upstream Rumble API restriction that blocks active runtime execution.
- **Schemas:** Rumble-related schemas remain valid and authoritative; no deprecations or schema removals are planned.
- **Dashboard features:** No dashboard capabilities are removed or hidden while the runtime is paused; the UI remains schema-driven and ready to consume Rumble configuration.
- **Forward plan:** Rumble runtime re-enablement is expected once upstream access is restored, without requiring schema changes or dashboard rewrites.
