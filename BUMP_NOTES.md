# Bump Notes

## CURRENT VER= 0.4.1-alpha / PENDING VER= 0.4.2-alpha

### Technical Notes

- Repo-local version markers that mirror runtime authority still show `0.4.1-alpha` in `runtime/version.py`, `runtime/exports/version.json`, and `docs/runtime/exports/version.json`.
- Recent admin work in `docs/js/analytics.js`, `docs/js/analytics-alerting.js`, `docs/js/state.js`, `docs/js/app.js`, and `docs/css/components.css` now spans dedicated Alerts/Analytics route separation, richer location formatting, hydration hardening, tokenized alert-template editing, and checkbox-based multi-surface filtering aligned to the newer runtime alert contract.
- Admin shell updates in `docs/js/app.js`, `docs/js/admin-gate.js`, and related icon assets continue the route/layout cleanup work that keeps the dedicated Alerts workspace separate from Analytics while preserving the shared dashboard shell.
- `README.md` is already staged as `v0.4.2-alpha`, so the repo currently reflects release-prep documentation ahead of the copied runtime/export version markers.

### Human-Readable Notes

- Alerts are now treated as their own admin workspace rather than feeling like a narrow Analytics subpanel, while Analytics has been restored as its own dedicated reporting page with the geo/map surface intact.
- Rule editing is easier to reason about because placeholders are visible as tokens, the variable catalog is better organized, and scope selection matches the real backend shape more closely.
- Sidebar and shell polish continued alongside runtime-regression recovery so the admin surface reflects the routing/layout cleanup already visible in the repo without losing the analytics experience.

### Files / Areas Touched

- `docs/js/analytics-alerting.js`
- `docs/js/analytics.js`
- `docs/js/state.js`
- `docs/js/admin-gate.js`
- `docs/js/app.js`
- `docs/views/alerts.html`
- `docs/css/components.css`
- `docs/js/api-usage.js`
- `docs/runtime/exports/version.json`
- `runtime/version.py`
- `README.md`

### Follow-Ups / Risks

- Keep the dashboard placeholder picker and surface labels aligned with the authoritative runtime alert-variable catalog during the actual version bump and release-note pass.
- Resolve the README `v0.4.2-alpha` prep state against the still-copied `0.4.1-alpha` runtime/export files when the real bump lands.

## Session Milestone - 2026-03-20

### Information Architecture + Regression Recovery

- Alerts was split out from the former combined "Alerts & Analytics" surface into its own dedicated sidebar-accessible admin page, with the route/layout work preserved in the current shell.
- Analytics was then explicitly restored as its own page after the overreach/regression phase, including restoration of the geographic/map-driven analytics experience instead of collapsing it into the Alerts workspace.
- The urgent Analytics runtime regression caused by the missing `labelize` helper was fixed in `docs/js/analytics.js`, and guardrails were added so a non-critical formatter failure no longer blanks the page.

### Analytics Geo + Hydration Hardening

- Analytics location display/formatting was improved to use cleaner city/region/country fallback labels consistently across tables, request details, and the map-driven view.
- Admin hydration reliability was hardened in `docs/js/state.js`, `docs/js/overview.js`, and the analytics loaders through corrected timeout forwarding, `Promise.allSettled`-style partial hydration, and reduced overlap/retry storm behavior so one failing section does not blank the whole page.
- The admin analytics UI now exposes the richer geo rollout from runtime state while remaining resilient when some sections are offline or return partial data.
- `FindMeHere Directory` / `directory` was added to the admin analytics/reporting surface so that traffic from `findmehere.live` is shown distinctly instead of being rolled into generic public traffic.

### Alerts UX + Rule Authoring

- The dedicated Alerts page layout was refined heavily: terminology was cleaned up away from confusing template wording, helper copy and previews were clarified, delivery defaults were reorganized, and the rules/editor workspace spacing was rebalanced.
- The rules browser now supports a bounded browsing surface with list/gallery-style presentation, cleaner chips, severity-tinted rule cards, clearer action-button treatments, and Windows/Pushover chip icon support where implemented.
- Editor usability improved through preview/editor balancing, placeholder helper repositioning, grouped placeholder categories, and expanded placeholder coverage including `user_code`, `client_ip`, page fields, and richer geo/account/request fields.
- Placeholder entry for title/message fields now supports tokenized inline placeholders while preserving the backend raw `{{variable}}` syntax, and the single-surface selector was replaced with backward-compatible multi-surface checkbox filtering.
- `page_path` values on admin alert/history/detail surfaces now render as clickable links when a valid canonical page URL is present.
- Placeholder catalog presentation was tightened after the expansion so the larger variable set remains scannable instead of turning into an unstructured wall of options.

### Country Flag Placeholder Enhancements

- The Alerts admin workspace now consumes the backend-authored `{{country_flag}}` placeholder as its own additive Geo variable, keeping it visually/cosmetically separate from plain-text geo placeholders like country, country code, region, and city.
- Local Alerts previews and retained history cards now upgrade `country_flag` into a lightweight inline badge treatment on richer browser surfaces while still preserving raw stored template text and backend compatibility.
- When richer rendering is not available, the dashboard continues to degrade safely to the resolved logical value from runtime, including Unicode emoji or compact `fl-...` fallback tokens.

### Shell + Validation Notes

- Sidebar/admin shell icon mapping was updated so the current `SIDEBAR_VIEW_ICON_MAP` is the actual source of truth and swapped SVG assets refresh reliably without route or declared asset-path changes.
- Repo-visible validation for this milestone is primarily state/history-backed hotfix work rather than a new automated dashboard test suite; no dedicated dashboard test harness was added in this repo-visible slice.
