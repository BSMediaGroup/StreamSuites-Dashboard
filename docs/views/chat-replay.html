  <title>Historical Chat Replay (Planned)</title>
  <!--
    Placeholder view for a future Historical Chat Replay surface.

    Intended experience (descriptive only):
    - Load a pre-recorded chat log JSON (platform-agnostic) from local storage or a provided URL.
    - Render messages chronologically with timestamps, author display names, and platform hints.
    - Provide playback controls (play/pause, seek, speed) that emulate the original pacing without executing bot actions.
    - Support stream-specific lookup (by stream_id) to filter or load relevant logs.
    - Remain fully read-only with no outbound actions or bot control hooks.

    No scripting is wired yet. This file is a scaffold only.

    <h1>Historical Chat Replay (Planned)</h1>
    <p>
      This placeholder documents the intended layout for a future chat replay view.
      The final implementation will remain static and read-only, consuming exported chat logs
      without controlling live bots or altering runtime behavior.

      <h2>Planned UI Blocks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chat log source selector (file picker or URL input)</li>
        <li>Stream lookup field (e.g., by stream_id)</li>
        <li>Chronological message list with timestamp and author labels</li>
        <li>Playback controls for pacing (play, pause, seek, speed)</li>
        <li>Platform indicator badges for multi-platform logs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        This view will not modify data, trigger bots, or manage authentication. It is intended for
        visualization of previously captured chat activity only.
