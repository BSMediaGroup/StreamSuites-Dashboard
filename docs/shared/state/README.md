# Runtime Exports

This directory houses static, authoritative JSON exports generated by the runtime. These files are intended for downstream consumers (such as the dashboard) to ingest without requiring live runtime dependencies.

- `changelog.json` provides runtime-scoped changelog entries that mirror the dashboard changelog schema for static consumption.
- Existing exports (clips, polls, tallies, scoreboards) remain unchanged and continue to serve as reference data snapshots.

## Runtime changelog export (authoritative)
- `changelog.runtime.json` is the single source of truth for runtime changelog entries.
- It is consumed by the StreamSuites-Dashboard repository and merged client-side with dashboard-scope entries.
- The schema is backward compatible; entries are additive and IDs must never be reused or mutated once published.
- The canonical shape for these entries lives in `../../changelog/changelog.runtime.json`; any export or formatter should align to that structure and emit JSON only.
- Export is manual or CI-driven — it is **not** triggered by the runtime, and no background writers or file watchers should be introduced here.

<!-- Future-proofing note: this export may later be generated or appended to by GitHub Actions or release tooling, but no automation is implemented yet. -->
