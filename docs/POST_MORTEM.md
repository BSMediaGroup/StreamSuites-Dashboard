# StreamSuites Dashboard Post-Mortem (Indefinite Suspension)

## Dashboard Role in the Ecosystem
- Served as a static, client-side surface for inspecting and drafting configuration aligned with StreamSuites runtimes.
- Rendered schema-driven panels, historical roadmap context, and exported snapshots without live API calls.
- Provided a GitHub Pages-safe way to view runtime artifacts and validate JSON drafts.

## Dependency on Runtime Exports
- All meaningful data originated from runtime-produced exports (e.g., `creators.json`, `platforms.json`, `runtime_snapshot.json`).
- UI panels assumed fresh artifacts would be generated by active runtimes and dropped into expected paths.
- Without export refreshes, the dashboard presents stale or placeholder data only.

## Why the Dashboard Cannot Function Independently
- No bundled backend or live connectors; the UI never issued runtime mutations or fetched live telemetry.
- Schema validations and visualizations require current runtime artifacts to be meaningful.
- Any “state” shown is a reflection of static files rather than an authoritative system.

## Impact of Runtime Failure on Dashboard Viability
- Suspension of the runtimes halted export generation, freezing all observable state.
- Roadmap indicators and telemetry panels no longer correspond to real progress or live metrics.
- Attempting to edit configurations here has no operational target and no deployment path.

## Decision to Freeze Rather Than Remove
- Removing the site would erase reference material useful for documentation handoffs and design continuity.
- Freezing preserves transparency around prior intent, scope, and schema usage without implying active support.
- Static hosting imposes minimal maintenance while keeping historical context available.

## Preservation Rationale
- Maintains a record of UI structure, layout decisions, and schema-driven component patterns for future teams.
- Provides documentation for how exports were expected to shape the experience, aiding any potential revival.
- Serves as a visual and textual artifact of the StreamSuites ecosystem despite runtime suspension.
